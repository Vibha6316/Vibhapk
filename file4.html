<b>Haukadalur, Iceland</b>
One of the more unique waterfalls we had ever seen in the world, this wild and wide waterfall tumbled on the Hvítá River in two tiers at 90 degree angles to each other.

Part of the Golden Circle of Iceland’s main attractions in the Southwest, it pretty much sat on everyone’s travel itineraries.

In addition to the falls’ unique shape, we also saw rainbows arcing over the falls when we weather cooperated.

Thus, we had no issues with including this golden waterfall on our list of favorites.
