<h1>SUTHERLAND FALLS</h1>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<b>Fiordland National Park, New Zealand</b>.
In a country that holds a special place in our hearts, this gorgeous 580m waterfall was easily New Zealand’s most spectacular waterfall.

Julie and I found it to be heads-and-shoulders better than the other waterfalls that we’ve visited in the Land of the Long White Cloud.

And given its remote location deep in the wild and beautiful Fiordland National Park (a UNESCO World Heritage Area), we definitely had to earn our visit. As one of many highlights of the Milford Track – proclaimed as one of the finest walks in the world – it sat in one of New Zealand’s most scenic spots.

Indeed, this waterfall had a lot going for it, and we just had to make room for it on this list.
