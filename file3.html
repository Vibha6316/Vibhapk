<b>Vatnajökull (Jökulsárgljúfur) National Park, Iceland.</b>
<b>This was one of Europe’s most powerful waterfalls</b>

Sending glacial melt-waters over its 44m precipice unchecked at a flow of around 500 cubic meters per second, we literally felt the ground tremble beneath our feet as we stood and watched such awesome power from up close!

Positioned at the head of the impressive Jökulsárgljúfur (the Icelandic version of the Grand Canyon) while surrounded by three other major waterfalls on the same river, it epitomized the wild and raw landscape that characterized Iceland.

Indeed, nature lovers from both near and far loved this waterfall.

So we easily included this juggernaut on our Top 10 Best Waterfalls List.
