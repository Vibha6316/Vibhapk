<h1>YOSEMITE FALLS</h1>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<b>Yosemite National Park (California), USA</b>
Even though this waterfall doesnâ€™t flow year round, it does flow for a good part of the year. Plus, it dropped a whopping 2,425ft making it one of the tallest in the world.

As the crown jewel of attractions in the incomparable Yosemite Valley, we managed to see this waterfall from a multitude of viewpoints and trails.

Julie and I have seen this falls so many times and in so many ways that we tend to think of it like an old friend.

So given its ease of access, scenery, location, and sheer size, we had no doubt about including this waterfall in our Top 10 Best Waterfalls List.
